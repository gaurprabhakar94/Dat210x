Assignment 1
Explored the City of Chicago's Crime data set, which is part of their Open Data initiative. Targeted Gambling as the Crime Activity 
and ran K-means clustering for finding possible places where police officers might have to investigate. 

****************************************************************

Assignment 2

Used a sample CDR dataset generated for 10 people living in the Dallas, Texas metroplex area. 
Partly de-anonymized the CDR data. Tried to find the predictable manners of people moving from home to work with a few errands in between and ran 
K-Means on it to isolate the geolocations where a person spends the most of their time.

****************************************************************

Assignment 3

Continued on with the previous lab, but validated results by comparing the user's weekday activity to their weekend activity.

****************************************************************

Assignment 4

Used the Wholesale Customer's dataset, hosted by UCI's Machine Learning. Understood the features of the dataset in terms of which one's should be removed, 
and how to scale them in order for the 'blind' clustering to preform correctly. Performed feature scaling and then ran unsupervised clustering to scan the 
features and then group the samples based off of them. 

****************************************************************

Assignment 5
Performed PCA on data followed by running a KNeighborsClassifier on it and then checked the accuracy of model.

****************************************************************

Assignment 6

Explored the dataset of image samples. Transformed them either using PCA to reduce their linear dimensionality, or isomap to non-linearly do the same.
Then trained the KNeighborsClassifier to identify what direction a face is pointing towards: either up, down, left, or right.

Assignment 7

Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Original  data set, provided courtesy of UCI's Machine Learning Repository. 
Loaded and cleaned up the dataset and performed feature scaling since the features used different units. Then implemented PCA and IsoMap
to test the performance of both and as the technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset down to two variables.
Finally, trained a KNeighborsClassifier on the 2D projected training dataset, scored the KNeighborsClassifier and plotted a decision boundary for visual confirmation.

Assignment 8

Used the subset of a life expectancy dataset, provided courtesy of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics page. 
Performed linear regression to extrapolate how long people will live in the future and then tested the performance of the model.
****************************************************************

Assignment 9

Performed linear regression using a public dataset provided courtesy of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, called College Acceptance and Enrollment. 
Plotted Regression line and regression plane to determine the relationship between different variables better.
There are four relationships we are interested in modeling:

Assignment 10

Used linear regression to recover a completely deleted portion of an audio file. Used The FSDD, Free-Spoken-Digits-Dataset, an audio dataset 
put together by Zohar Jackson.
