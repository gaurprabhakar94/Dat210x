Assignment 1
Performed support vector classifier by revisiting UCI's wheat-seeds dataset. 
First, benchmarked how long it was taking to train and predict with SVC relative to how long K-Neighbors took to train and test,
and then compared the decision boundary plot produced by the two.

****************************************************************

Assignment 2

Trained a support vector classifier using machine learning, and checked classification accuracy agains the advertised USPS stats.
This was done using the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset, provided by UCI's Machine Learning Repository.

Assignment 3

Applied SVC to the Parkinson's Data Set, provided by UCI's Machine Learning Repository. Then tried to differentiate between people who have 
Parkinson's and who don't, and then tried to fine-tune the parameters in an attempt to maximize the accuracy of the testing set.

****************************************************************

Assignment 4

By using UCI's wheat-seeds dataset, benchmarked training and prediction times with decision trees relative to the speed of KNeighbors and SVC, 
as well as compared the decision boundary plots produced by it.

****************************************************************

Assignment 5
Used decision trees against The Mushroom Data Set, drawn from the Audobon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). 
The data set details mushrooms described in terms of many physical characteristics, such as cap size and stalk length, 
along with a classification of poisonous or edible.

Assignment 6

Trained a random forest against a public domain Human Activity Dataset titled Wearable Computing: Accelerometers' Data Classification 
of Body Postures and Movements. Within the dataset, there are five target activities: Sitting, Sitting Down, Standing, Standing Up, Walking
